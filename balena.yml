  OEMs need and want to differentiate themselves from competition by integrating IT software in their machines and plants. NUPANO is a tool for machine builders to integrate and manage their own as well as 3rd party digital services (Apps) at machine and plant level. NUPANO Lenze enables you to handle such Apps in an easy way - even with a growing installed base. It gives you full transparency on which App in which version is running on which machine.

  ## Technical concept 
  
  NUPANO consists of:
  
  1. **The NUPANO Cloud platform**<br>
  
  Machine builders manage their machine fleet as well as all their apps and the assignment to specific machines. The cloud software part of NUPANO is a fully modular and dynamic multitenant microservice architecture.
  
  
  2. **The NUPANO Runtime**<br>
  
  It requires a Docker infrastructure on an X86 64-bit architecture. It can be e.g. an Industry PC or an Edge device at machine and plant level where the machine-related apps are executed.
  
  ## Runtime configuration
  
  The NUPANO runtime can be configured via environment variables.
